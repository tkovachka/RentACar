optimizing images:
Use Cloud Functions for Resizing Images

Upload a single high-quality image.
Use Firebase Cloud Functions with ImageMagick or Sharp to generate different sizes (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, etc.).
Use Firebase Storage URLs in Firestore

Instead of storing images in Firestore directly, store the URL in Firestore and fetch images dynamically.
Use WebP Instead of PNG/JPEG

WebP offers better compression and quality.
Lazy Load Images

Use cached_network_image to load images efficiently.
Optimize Network Calls

Use Firebase Storage rules to cache images and prevent multiple downloads.
